# Chat - A Windows 8 XMPP Messenger #

## Personal comment ##

Special thanks go to [Dieter Lunn](https://github.com/coder2000), who wrote the original ubiety XMPP library and [Andrew Joyce](http://mosaic.ws/), who helped me a LOT with improving the design(he's really talented).

The Application is available for free in the [Windows Store](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/chat/1e215c25-ddd0-4f8c-b62d-b2ad26a4f29e) and I decided to make the code open source in order to share my efforts.

There are things in Chat I don't like, the UI code and storage system (there even is a [Project](https://github.com/PaulFreund/StoreEngine) to change that) for example, but I don't have enough time to change that at the moment and I think most of you know this situation.

## Dependencies ##

Chat depends on my fork of the ubiety XMPP library. The library is linked as a submodule and available on github [here](https://github.com/PaulFreund/xmpp).

## Contributions ##

In order to improve not only the code but also the application in the store I would be happy to see others contribute to this project. There is also a feedback platform available [here](http://feedback.lvl3.org/).

## License ##

I chose the MIT license because I think that free software is only possible without limits. I hope nobody sees this as an invitation for brainless copy-pasting of the application code in order to make a fast buck.
